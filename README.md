# Gofiler - ease your profile management with go 

Manage projects across multiple sites at ease with go. 

Using a simple cli and SDK toolset you can manage multiple profiles across
freelance sites in a declarative way. Change in one place, update across the board.

### Benefits
1. Keep your profiles up to date with automatic skill recommendations based on projects delivered
2. Add certificates and licences in one place and be sure you always present your latest skills
3. Manage multiple sub profiles across providers to ensure you engage those niches you love so much

### Role of Gofiler in the SkillSmart ecosystem:
1. Integration with trendscout aggregates stats about in-demand skills and requirements from your associated job sites
in a single place
2. Gofiler provides the necessary abstraction for you to code any service add-on for SkillSmart based on your needs against
a clean, convenient API
3. Gofiler provides the external contract to 3rd parties wanting to programmatically engage with your profile. This gives
you as the data owner control over what information is used and keeps the stats with you.
4. Gofiler provides the modules needed for you to easily expand the range of connections currently offered out of the box
